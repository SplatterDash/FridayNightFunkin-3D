        DISCLAIMER
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

FNF:3D automatically starts up with this disclaimer info but I'm puttin it here for redundancy sake

FNF:3D contains flashing lights and rapid camera movements that may trigger epilepsy and/or motion sickness in some players!
If at any point you need to disable them, the options are as follows:

- Flashing Lights: "Visuals and UI -> Flashing Lights"
- Camera Movements (NOT camera zooms that occur every section): "Graphics -> Camera Effects"

Remember you can access the options menu at any time, even when paused during gameplay!

    SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

why has nobody talked about the system requirements needed for FNF smhmh

FNF:3D runs a consistent 60 FPS on a Windows/Linux/Mac with the following minimum specs:
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 5000, Intel Core I3 or similar model
- GPU: literally anything, even a potato works
- RAM: 2 GB minimum
- Audio: it's a rhythm game dummy OF COURSE you need some way to output audio

FNF:3D utilizes multithreading during loading to keep the RAM usage down in lieu of GPU processing, which is why a strong CPU is recommended.
If needed, you can utilize graphics settings to lower the amount of CPU/RAM usage and increase performance.
These settings are located in the Options menu in game, under "Graphics".

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        PERMISSIONS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Like the vanilla FNF game, you have full permission to basically do whatever you want with FNF:3D.
This includes streams/letsplays/reactions, memes, remixes, and so forth.
It'd be cool though if you include a little credit! Even some links would do nicely.

speaking of which
